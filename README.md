# Jose Estrada | Software Engineer

Hi, thanks for getting interested in my profile! 👋🏽

I'm a Software Engineer with knowledge in Object-Oriented Programming, Design Patterns, Data Structures, and Databases. I have experience building Desktop Applications using Java and C#; Web and Mobile using React, Angular, IONIC, and Flutter frameworks. Also, I have been a leader in Development Teams, where I actively collaborated in different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle. At college, I offered mentorship to other students through PASA Program (Academic Support and Follow-up Program).

# Certifications
## 📔 Diplomado en Desarrollo Web y Móviles utilizando Angular e IONIC
🏫 Issued by Universidad Estatal de Sonora

📆 (June 28th — August 6th, 2021)

😺 I learn how to implement text interpolation, pipes, property bindings, event and two-way bindings. Used different directives for components (*directives with a template*), attributes (*to listen and modify behavior of other HTML elements, attributes, properties, and components*) and structure (*change the DOM layout by managing DOM elements*) to add additional behavior to forms, list, styles and other elements. Dependency injection for services in component's constructor and other services; routing to navigate between pages or tabs. Also, we used Firebase Realtime Database and Firestore to interact with No-SQL databases. And finally, deployed our apps using Firebase Hosting. Working with IONIC, I also learned how to prepare for release by signing our app and generate APK package ready to upload to the Play Console.

## 📘 APIs and Microservices
🏆 Issued by freeCodeCamp

📆 (June 17th — July 2nd, 2021)

😺 In this Certification, I learned how to write back end with Node.js, npm (*Node Package Manager*), the Express framework, and MongoDB (*non-relational or "NoSQL" database that stores JSON documents*). Working with npm and the package.json helped me to understand how to manage project dependencies. Also, I used some built-in modules from Node.js to work with HTTP and the request/response cycle and the Express framework to create a server and handle routing for applications.

Finally, I build 5 projects to put these skills, principles and concepts to work.

* [x] [Timestamp][7]
* [x] [Request Header Parser][8]
* [x] [URL Shortener][9]
* [x] [Exercise Tracker][10]
* [x] [File Metadata][11]

## 📘 Front End Development Libraries
🏆 Issued by freeCodeCamp

📆 (May 10th — June 16th, 2021)

😺 In this Certification, I learned how to style websites quickly applying mobile-first approach using Bootstrap, add logic to CSS styles and extend them with SASS, create powerful SPAs (*Single Page Applications*) with React and Redux for building reusable, component-driven user interfaces and share data across different components.

Finally, I build 5 projects to put these skills, principles and concepts to work. 

* [x] Random Quote Machine
* [x] Markdown Previewer
* [x] Drum Machine
* [x] JavaScript Calculator
* [x] 25 + 5 Clock

## 📒 Diplomado en Educación Financiera
🏆 Issued by CONDUSEF

📆 (February 16th — May 3rd, 2021)

🤑 En este Diplomado aprendí la Importancia de la Educación Financiera y su contexto, los componentes y su relación con las nuevas tecnologías. Así mismo, de las diferentes instituciones, seguros y el mercado de valores, además de desarrollar presupuestos que me han permitido gestionar mis ingresos y egresos personales.

## 📗 Responsive Web Design
🏆 Issued by freeCodeCamp

📆 (March 10th — April 15th, 2021)

😺 In this Certification, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS, how to apply different elements of Visual Design, best practices for building webpages accesible to everyone and Responsive Web Design Principles to design flexible websites that can respond to different screen sizes, orientation and resolutions with Flexbox and CSS Grid.

Finally, I build 5 projects to put these skills, principles and concepts to work. 

* [x] Tribute Page
* [x] Survey Form
* [x] Product Landing Page
* [x] Technical Documentation Page
* [x] Personal Portfolio Page

## 📕 JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
🏆 Issued by freeCodeCamp

📆 (February 2nd — March 24th, 2021)

😺 In this Certification, I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript (*variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions*), ES6 (*including let and const, arrow functions, classes, promises, and modules*), and Regular Expressions. Then, applied that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings and factorialize numbers. I also learned about OOP (*Object Oriented Programing*), and Functional Programing (*including pure functions, how to avoid mutations, and how write cleaner code*).

Finally, I build the next projects to put these JavaScript skills to work.

* [x] Palindrome Checker
* [x] Roman Numeral Converter
* [x] Caesars Cipher
* [x] Telephone Number Validator
* [x] Cash Register
