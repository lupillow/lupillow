I'm a Software Engineer working full-time as a Front End Developer at Pinnacle Aerospace ✈️, with over 4 years of experience building Web and Mobile Applications in both small and large teams. I've been recognised by Pinnacle with a Spot Award ⭐️ for being an essential team player and adding valuable effort to my team's success. I use React and TypeScript, plus other tools like JetBrains' WebStorm, Postman, GitLab, and Jira.

Proficient at deconstructing mockup designs and translating wireframes into high quality code that can be reusable and maintainable over time. I also have some knowledge on databases, docker containers, and express servers.
